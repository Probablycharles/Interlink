    <h2 id="box1"><big>"</big>The two most developed countries in multiple aspects, China and America differ in multiple ways. For the younger generation, due to COVID, there have been limited opportunities to learn about each other‚Äôs culture except through social media and news reports. This results in many misconceptions of the alternative culture on another continent. Moreover, as an international school, most of us hope to apply for US colleges; however, a lot of us are anxious about life in America not just because of being Asian, but more because of uncertainty of the lifestyles there.<big>"</big></h2>

    <h2 id="box2"><big>"</big>Therefore, as students with multicultural backgrounds, we hope to foster the development of direct communication between Chinese and American high school students, starting with the Nord Anglia and WASC networking that DAIS possesses, and further expanding towards DAIS alumni, or even undergraduates and professionals in the top universities.<big>"</big></h2>

    <h2 id="box3"><big>"</big>InterLink is a student-led organization, aiming to foster communication between Chinese and American teenagers, aiming for an exchange of culture between the two groups, hoping that each participant can gain a more direct understanding of the culture and school life overseas, especially giving Chinese students a specific idea of how life is in America. It would be an opportunity to utilize our identity as multicultural individuals to connect cultures through teenagers and high school students using social media, websites, and online conference platforms. Through the events that are brought out in the Action Plan section, we attempt to foster connections between teenagers from separate continents, envisioning a more thorough understanding between two different groups of teenagers, achieving our goal to build friendly connections between Chinese and American teenagers.<big>"</big></h2>
